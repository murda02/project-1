## Description
How many times have you and your friends or family sat down to enjoy a movie and some food and discover that you dont know what to watch or what to eat. Often times you spend the limited time you had to watch a movie just trying to locate an acceptable option. This project was desinged with you in mind, we want to help remove the struggle of picking a movie from you life. This application will allow you to select a movie using the search criteria of genre, how old of a movie you are willing to watch, and the length of movie you are searching for. 
## Installation
This does not require any installation. simply visit it's location on the web. 

## Usage
The movie search form requires that the user has an input in all search fields. The movie genre field currenlty requires that the user maually inputs the genre the wish to select. The intent is that this will be changed to a dropdown menu to prevent users selecting invalid genres or possible spelling errors. The movies made after field allows the user to enter a year which will only allow movies made during or after that year to be listed when the form is submitted. The movie runtime field allows the user to select the minimum runtime of the movie.

The food search form allows the user to input the zipcode for the area the user is looking to find food options at. The intent for the type of food field is that the user will be able to input a type of food that they would like to see close to them.
